# Maze Pathfinding Visualizer 🧩

A **Python-based interactive maze game** built with **Streamlit** that visualizes **BFS vs A\*** pathfinding algorithms step by step.

---

## Features ✨

* Generates random mazes
* Compares **BFS** and **A\*** algorithms visually
* Step-by-step animations showing the pathfinding process
* Interactive controls for maze size, start/end points, and speed
* Clean Streamlit interface, deployable on **Streamlit Cloud**

## Dependencies 📦

All required packages are in `requirements.txt`, e.g.,
`streamlit`, `numpy`, `pyamaze`, `matplotlib`

---

**Note:**

* Do **not** include `venv/` in the repo.
* Use relative paths in code so it works locally and on Streamlit.
